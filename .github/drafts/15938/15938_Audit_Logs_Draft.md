# Audit logs

The audit log is a report of all activities that occur on an Appsmith instance. It will automatically capture and display events by recording who performed an activity, when it occurred, and where it was performed. With this information, you can ensure that you're able to easily follow up and address any unexpected or undesirable events.

You can find audit logs by navigating to your Admin Settings page, and finding the **Audit Logs** tab under the **Others** heading. From here, you can see all the events that have been tracked under your organization's account, along with the user, date, and time that the event was logged. Click the arrow next to any event to expand it and see its full set of details in JSON form.

## Logged events

There are several types of events tracked in Appsmith's audit logs:

- App-specific activity
    - Changes to pages/widgets
    - Datasource configuration
    - Running queries
    - Deleting apps

- Admin settings changes
    - Who changed certain settings

- User sign-up and login activity

For an exhaustive list of events, see [Tracked Events](#tracked-events) below.

## Log Contents

Each logged item has a number of data points that describe that event, as well as any related apps, datasources, queries, and workspaces. This data is organized into JSON format.

## Searching audit logs

{Video demo: exploration of logs and filtering}

There are a number of filters available to help you quickly search for a subset of your logs. You can filter your logs by:
- User: To get a trace of activities performed by a user, filter by their email address.
- Event: Filter events by their name; for example, to find all logs related to query execution, filter by the `query.executed` event.
- ResourceId: A resourceID identifies each entity on your Appsmith instance, be it a workspace, application, page, datasource, query or JSObject.
- Date Range: Narrow down logs by searching for only a certain range of time.

From the JSON area of any event, you may also click any of the values to search for other instances of that value.
