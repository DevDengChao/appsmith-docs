# Instance Management

## Checkpoint version and upgrades

When you upgrade manually, you must upgrade to the checkpoint version released between your version and the latest version.

Appsmith checkpoint versions:
* v1.9.2

### Prerequisites
* Before proceeding, upgrade your Embedded or Custom MongoDB server to use MongoDB v5. See the list of [compliant platforms](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/production-notes/#platform-support), and [Upgrade a Replica Set to 5.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/5.0-upgrade-replica-set/) once your infrastructure is in place. 

### Upgrade to a checkpoint version
Access your Appsmith instance and make the below change to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>
  
From:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
```

To:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```


</TabItem>
   <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">
   
From:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
    container_name: appsmith
```

To:

```bash
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.9.2
    container_name: appsmith
```
   
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save and run the below command on your shell to restart Appsmith.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Your server starts with the older version that makes all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. Once this process has been completed successfully (you can verify this by logging in to your Appsmith instance), you can return to the original version of your `docker-compose.yml` file and resume normal operations.


<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>

  ```bash
  services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">

  ```
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Run the restart command once again: 

 ```
 docker-compose up -d
  ```
:::note 
If you haven't been using your Appsmith instance for a while, it could be possible that there might be multiple versions that show up in the error message. In such a case, perform the same steps for each version in order, starting from the oldest.

### Downgrade from a checkpoint version
Access your Appsmith instance and make the below change to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

<Tabs groupId="appsmithEditions" queryString="current-edition">
  <TabItem value="CE" label="Community Edition" default>

  ```bash
  services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ce:v1.8.5
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="BE" label="Business Edition">

  ```
services:
  appsmith:
    image: index.docker.io/appsmith/appsmith-ee:v1.8.15
    container_name: appsmith
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Run the restart command: 

```
 docker-compose up -d
```
Your server starts with version 1.8.15 that makes all the necessary schema changes to your Appsmith instance. 

## Switching off auto updates

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, the `auto_update` container is responsible for periodically checking for updates to Appsmith and applying those updates. If you wish to disable this auto updating, please run the below command:

```
docker-compose rm -s -v -f auto_update
```

This brings down the `auto_update` container, and update checks are no-longer performed. Note that however, if you run `docker-compose up -d` later, for any reason, then this `auto_update` will be brought up again. You can use that to turn auto updates on again in the future.

To check if auto updates are turned on in your instance, please run `docker-compose ps` and see if there a server called `auto_update` listed in the output, and if it's status is `Up`. If not, then auto updates are turned off for your instance.
