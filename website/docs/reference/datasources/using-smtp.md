## Connection Settings

The SMTP datasource requires the following information to establish a connection. All fields are mandatory.

![Click to expand](/img/smtp_create_datasource.png)

1. **Host address:** This is the host address of the SMTP server.
2. **Port:** The port over which you will communicate with the SMTP server. Typically this is 25 or 587.
3. **Username:** The username of the SMTP server.
4. **Password:** The password of the SMTP server. Please note that if you have a multi-factor authentication setup for your SMTP server, your normal password may not work. You may have to generate a separate password from your provider, which will work without multi-factor authentication.

## Send Email

This action sends an email with a dynamic subject and body to a list of the recipient(s). You can also optionally attach files along with this email.

```
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email sent successfully"
}
```

On the other hand, if Appsmith encounters an error while sending the email, an error will be displayed on the screen. An example is shown below: ![Click to expand](/img/smtp_error_response.png)
