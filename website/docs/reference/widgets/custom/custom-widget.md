# Custom

This page provides information on using the Custom widget, which allows you to integrate React, HTML, and JavaScript components for additional functionality. 

To embed web pages or applications, use the IFrame widget.


## Content properties

#### Edit Source

Allows you to customize the code for the custom widget. When clicked, it opens a dedicated page where you can conveniently modify and update the widget's code to suit your requirements.

#### Default Model

<dd>


This property allows you to pass data to the custom widget's code editor. 


* To access the data in the javascript editor use `appsmith.model`.

* To access data in CSS use `var(--appsmith-model-{property-name}`

* Create events in the widget and trigger them in the javascript file using `appsmith.triggerEvent('eventName')`

</dd>






### General

#### Visible `boolean`

<dd>

Controls the visibility of the widget. If you turn off this property, the widget would not be visible in View Mode. Additionally, you can use JavaScript by clicking on **JS** next to the **Visible** property to conditionally control the widget's visibility. The default value for the property is `true`.

For example, if you want to make the widget visible only when the user selects "Yes" from a Select widget, you can use the following JavaScript expression: 
```js
{{Select1.selectedOptionValue === "Yes"}}
```



</dd>



### Events

#### Custom Events

</div>


Allows you to configure one or multiple actions (Framework functions, queries, or JS functions) tailored to your specific requirements. 

For example, if your custom widget necessitates a reset functionality, you can create an **onReset** event and specify the corresponding action to be executed. 

</dd>





## Reference properties

Reference properties are properties that are not available in the property pane but can be accessed using the dot operator in other widgets or JavaScript functions. They provide additional information or allow interaction with the widget programmatically. For instance, to get the visibility status, you can use `FilePicker1.isVisible`.

#### model `string`

<dd>


The `model` property retrieves the value from the **Default Model** property and the Custom widget.

Example:

```js
{{Custom1.model}}

// Accessing a specific property 
{{Custom1.model.signatureImage}}
```

</dd>

#### isVisible `boolean`

<dd>

The `isVisible` property indicates the visibility state of a widget, with true indicating it is visible and false indicating it is hidden.

Example:

```js
{{Custom1.isVisible}}
```

</dd>
