# Setup Server-side Filtering on Table

This page shows you how to set up server-side filtering on a Table widget, which allows you to refine query results based on specific criteria.

Server-side filtering involves using a value to narrow down the results of a query in a similar way to server-side searching. However, instead of searching for a specific term, the selected value is used to filter out unwanted data from the requested dataset. 


## Configure query

To implement server-side filtering, you can use widgets such as the [Select](/reference/widgets/select/), [Checkbox](/reference/widgets/checkbox), [Sliders](/reference/widgets/category-slider) and other similar widgets that allow users to select from a variety of available filters.

*Example*: If you want to filter table data based on specific criteria, such as gender, you can use a Select widget with the required option.

1. Configure the query to fetch data using `selectedOptionValue` reference properties:

    * For PostgreSQL, you can configure the query as follows:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE gender = {{Select1.selectedOptionValue}};
    ```

    * For the REST API, configure query parameter as shown in the URL:

    ```
    https://mock-api.appsmith.com/users?gender={{Select1.selectedOptionValue}}
    ```

3. Set the Select widget's **onOptionChange** event to execute the fetch query.
